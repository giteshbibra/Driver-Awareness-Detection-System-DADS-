# Driver Awareness Detection System (DADS)
## Introduction:
The Driver Awareness Detection System (DADS) is an innovative solution aimed at enhancing road safety by detecting driver drowsiness and fatigue in real-time. Utilizing the cutting-edge InceptionV3 deep learning model alongside YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, DADS provides a non-invasive, efficient, and accurate system for monitoring driver alertness. Developed as part of a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering with specialization in Big Data Analytics, this system leverages facial recognition technologies to identify signs of fatigue, such as eye closure and yawning, to trigger alerts and prevent potential accidents.

## Technology Stack:

Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras for model building and transfer learning.
Object Detection: OpenCV for real-time face and eye tracking.
Programming Language: Python.
Data Handling: NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Features:

### Real-Time Detection: 
Monitors and analyzes driver's facial features in real-time to detect signs of drowsiness.
### Alert System: 
Triggers an audio-visual alert to the driver upon detecting signs of fatigue, enhancing driver reaction time.
High Accuracy: Employs InceptionV3 and YOLO architectures, fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset of driver images under various conditions, achieving high detection accuracy.
### Non-Invasive Monitoring: 
Provides a non-intrusive monitoring system that respects privacy while ensuring safety.
Wide Application: Suitable for implementation in personal vehicles, commercial fleets, and across various transportation modes.
